<p class="dropCap">
    My time is sooooo short <i class="em em-sweat"></i> but  since my last <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/programming/2019/03/30/Archive-and-Thrive-1/"><strong><u>post</u></strong></a>  I manage  to do a few more mockup’s for this project, and  
    Im really looking foward to start the coding part !<br>
     Meanwhile, I <strong>“</strong>completed<strong>”</strong> the login page and  diary page. 
     <div class="container-fluid">
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col s12 m6 ">
                    <p class="heading text-center ">	
                        <b class="primary-yellow">Version 1.0 – “Archive & Thrive”  - Lock</b>
                    </p>
                    
                    <img  class="responsive-img" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/project_images/diarylock.png" alt="">
              </div>
              <div class="col s12 m6 ">
                <p class="heading text-center ">	
                        <b class="primary-yellow">Version 1.0 – “Login Page”  - Mobile & desktop</b>
                    </p>
                    <img  class="responsive-img" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/project_images/loginpage.png" alt="">
              </div>
             
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            I also defined what initially will be the entry point of the app where the user have the navigation to access each individual feature. <br>
            I’m still not sure about the type of authentication I’m going to use, 
            but I’m inclined to go with OpenId using identity providers. 
            I will definitely not to worry about it now but is something to think about as I need to be familiarized with the various methods. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In the Diary part the user will have to insert a 4 digit code to access it regardless of the of being already autheticaded for the main.
            After inactivity will be logged out. 
        </p>
          <div class="container-fluid">
                <div class="row">
                  <div class="col s12 m6 ">
                        <p class="heading text-center ">	
                                <b class="primary-yellow">Version 1.0 – “App entry-point”  - Mobile & desktop </b>
                            </p>
                        <img  class="responsive-img" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/project_images/entrypoint.png" alt="">
                    
                  </div>
                  <div class="col s12 m6 ">
                    <p class="heading text-center ">	
                            <b class="primary-yellow">Version 1.0 – “Diary access code”  - Mobile & desktop</b>
                        </p>
                        <img  class="responsive-img" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/project_images/lockdiary.png" alt="">
                  </div>
                 
                </div>
            </div>
            <p> Diary itself has a really simple layout. 
                I will probably add some UI to make it more appealing visually, but
                 that’s not the focus so far. Each entrance displays the heading and
                  the date it was posted - different color for each month. <br>
                  Search function available.<br>
                  When created and
                   submitted   a diary entrance can’t no longer be edited or deleted from the app. 
                   Can,  however,  be exported. A diary is a historic document and one  
                   shouldn’t rewrite history... so no deleting or editing here <i class="em em-wink"></i> .
                   The only way to delete it is to delete  the account itself.
                
                </p>
